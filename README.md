## My Projects
I do this stuff only for own pleasure. If you like some of this – have fun! And if you have questions, please feel free to send me an email (to <tquadrat.do@gmail.com>) or you can connect me on Telegram (at @tquadrat_do).

I write code mainly in Java, preferred using the latest language version (as of now – 2022-01-04 – this is Java 17) even with the preview features switched on.

To build the code, I am using Gradle (switched to it recently, previously I used Maven).

### Applications
Not yet much stuff here, but I am working on publishing it soon – after I move the build to Gradle and the code to Java 17.

### Tools
Same here …

### Libraries
#### The *Foundation* Libraries
I collected a bunch of libraries under the header *Foundation*; a lot of that stuff is 20 years old now, always updated to the latest language version. The latest and most demanding change was to adoption of modularisation (JigSaw).

##### *[foundation-base](https://tquadrat.github.io/foundation-base)*
The base for all the other stuff, also it is not much useful without the *foundation-util* library. But for some tools this is not necessary or just to big, so I separated some functionality into this library.

##### *[foundation-util](https://tquadrat.github.io/foundation-util)*
Add this library to make the most often used features available to your project.

##### *[foundation-testutil](https://tquadrat.github.io/foundation-testutil)*
Some tool classes that I use for my JUnit tests.

### Other Stuff
… stay tuned!
