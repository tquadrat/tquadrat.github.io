### General Stuff

#### AWT and Swing
- [Using Headless Mode in the Java SE Platform](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/headless.html)\
  This article explains how to use the headless mode capabilities of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE, formerly referred to as J2SE). It is a little bit old, but still valid, as long AWT (and Swing) are part of the Java Platform.
  JavaFX does not provide a headless mode, but if `java.awt.headless="true"` is set, a JavaFX GUI will most probably not start, too.
